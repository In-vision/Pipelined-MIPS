# Pipelined-MIPS

This processor was based on the processor shown in the book _Computer Organization and Design, The Hardware/Software Interface_ by __David A. Patterson__ and __John L. Hennessy__, and it is made to run the code we made for the Hanoi towers problem using recursivity.

I made this processor in the subject of Computer Arquitecture. Along this course, the professor divided us in teams of two.
This was our last practice, but we couldn't finish it due to having not enough time, so I decided to finish it by myself.
